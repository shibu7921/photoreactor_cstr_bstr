## HX711 Load Cell Project â€” bstr & cstr

This project contains two Arduino sketches, bstr and cstr, which utilize the HX711_ADC library to interface with HX711 load cell amplifiers for weight measurement. Additionally, an I2C Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is used to show readings and status messages. The sketches are programmed using the Arduino IDE and require both the HX711_ADC and LiquidCrystal_I2C libraries.

The HX711_ADC library is licensed under the MIT License. See the library repository for details.
